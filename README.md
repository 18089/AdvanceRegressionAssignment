## Problem Statement
A US-based housing company leveraging data analytics for strategic property investments, is expanding into the Australian market. To guide their decision-making process, a regression model incorporating regularization techniques is proposed. This model aims to predict the actual values of prospective properties, assisting Surprise Housing in identifying lucrative investment opportunities and maximizing returns in the Australian real estate landscape.

## Objectives
This project focuses on three key objectives for Surprise Housing's expansion into the Australian real estate market. Firstly, it aims to identify the significant variables influencing house prices. Secondly, the study assesses how effectively these variables describe house prices. Lastly, the optimal values of lambda for both ridge and lasso regression models are determined through regularization techniques, ensuring the most accurate and efficient predictive models for informed investment decisions in the Australian housing market.
